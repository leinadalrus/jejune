<h1>Hello!</h1>
<i>It appears as though you have encountered a 404 error!</i>

<p><b><i>Do please redirect yourself back home</i></b> because this is like a void in space,
and there is nothing to do here but look at a blank page.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe something will appear here in the future? Maybe it's an error because 
the developer of this website is too lazy and has this in a TODO note or 
somethin', IDK?</p>
